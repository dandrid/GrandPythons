## Data Preparation

The Data Set is preprocessed in 4 steps. The results of the first three steps are serialized.

1. **STEP 1** trimming the silent data from the audio
2. **STEP 2** enriching the data set by adding noise to the audio data
3. **STEP 3** creating a spectogram from the audio data
4. **STEP 4** assembling the Data Frame
